This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and other relevant features to make predictions, helping financial institutions streamline the approval process.

ðŸ“Š Workflow:
1. Data Collection â€“ Import the loan dataset (CSV format)
2. Data Preprocessing â€“ Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Understand patterns, correlations, and key insights
4. Model Building â€“ Train and test using ML algorithms (KNeighborsClassifiers, RandomForestClassifiers, Support Vector Classifiers (SVC), Logistics Regression)
5. Model Evaluation â€“ Compare models based on performance metrics
6. Prediction â€“ Make predictions for new applications

Observation:
Random Forest Classifier is giving the best accuracy with an accuracy score of 82% for the testing dataset.

Future Improvements (May be):
1. Integrating deep learning models.
2. Deploying using Flask/Django or Streamlit.
3. Adding real-time loan application form for predictions.
